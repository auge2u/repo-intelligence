   - Advanced technology adoption

4. **Business & Customer Value**
   - Problem-solution alignment
   - User journey support
   - Monetization potential

5. **Team and Leadership Signals**
   - Code review dynamics
   - Collaboration patterns
   - Project structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

The `config.yaml` file allows you to customize:

- GitHub organizations to analyze
- Repository inclusion/exclusion filters
- Output directory structure
- Technical keywords to identify
- Service detection patterns
- Screenshot capture settings

## üìù Running Individual Phases

Instead of running the complete analysis, you can run individual phases:

```bash
# Extract data only
python src/extract_data.py --config config.yaml

# Analyze repositories
python src/analyze_repos.py --config config.yaml

# Collect screenshots
python src/collect_screenshots.py --config config.yaml

# Generate reports
python src/generate_reports.py --config config.yaml
```

## üîÑ Automation with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Action workflow that:
1. Runs weekly (or on-demand)
2. Performs the complete analysis
3. Generates all reports and visualizations
4. Uploads artifacts for download
5. Optionally deploys the portfolio to GitHub Pages
